COMPLETE HAND:
    - ANY NUMBER OF TRIPLES
    - EXACTLY ONE PAIR 
    - EACH TILE EXISTS ONLY ONCE (IN ONE TRIPLE OR PAIR)


ALGORITHM:
    1. VALIDATE THE LENGTH OF THE STRING:
        2. THE LENGTH SHOULD EITHER BE 2 (1 PAIR WITHOUT A TRIPLE) OR DIVISIBLE BY 3 AFTER SUBRACTING 2 ((len(string)-2)%3) (A PAIR + ANY NUMBER OF TRIPLES)
            - IF THE LENGTH IS NOT (1.), THE HAND IS "NOT COMPLETE"

            3. IF THE LENGTH IS 2: (IN CASE OF A PAIR WITHOUT A TRIPLE)
                - CHECK IF THE 2 CHARACTERS ARE THE SAME.
                    - IF THE 2 CHARACTERS ARE SAME, THE HAND IS "COMPLETE", ELSE IT IS NOT
    
            4. IF THE LENGTH IS NOT ((len(string)-2)%3): (IN CASE OF A PAIR + 1 OR MORE TRIPLES)
                - THE HAND IS "NOT COMPLETE"
            ELSE:
                5. CHECK FREQUENCY OF EACH TILE IN THE "HAND"
                    6. FIND TILES WITH FREQUENCY OF 2
                        - IF THERE'S MORE THAN 1 TILE WITH A FREQUENCY OF 2, THE HAND IS "NOT COMPLETE"
                        - IF THERE'S NO TILE WITH A FREQUENCY OF 2, THE HAND IS "NOT COMPLETE"
                    7. FIND TILES WITH A FREQUENCY OF 1 OR >3:
                        - IF THEY ARE PRESENT, THE HAND IS "NOT COMPLETE
                    8. IF CONDITION (6.) AND (7.) ARE NOT MET:
                        - THE HAND IS "COMPLETE"
