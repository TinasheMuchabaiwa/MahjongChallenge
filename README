PROBLEM STATEMENT:

You're working on making some mini-games, and you've decided to make a simpler variant of the game Mahjong.

In this variant, players have a number of tiles, each marked 0-9. The tiles can be grouped into pairs or tiples of the same tile.
A "complete hand" is defined as a collection of tiles where all the tiles can be grouped into any number of triples (zero or more) and exactly one pair, and each tile is used in exactly one triple or pair.

Write a function that takes a string representing a player's tiles in no particular order, and returns the string "COMPLETE" if the hand is complete, and "NOT COMPLETE" if it is not.

Each tile may only be used in a single group (either a pair or a triple). All tiles must be used to complete a hand. There may be a pair and triples of the same tile.

A single pair with no triples (ex:99) is a valid hand. The input will only consist of 0-9
